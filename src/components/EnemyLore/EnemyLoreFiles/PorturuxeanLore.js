          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the original races that co-founded the Galactic Alliance,
          Porturuxeans are one of the strongest superpower nations in Sector
          Alpha. Many cornerstone technological developments have been innovated
          by Porturuxean scientists, and their military might is powerful enough
          to contend with Hyjakker pirates and invading Holkovrhys
          simultaneously. They command a larger share of political power in the
          Alliance than most, however the other nations allow this due to the
          fact the Porturuxean Democracy tends to recognize the fact that their
          strength is derived from their close relationships with their allies.
          Their only true faults are derived from their tendency to distrust the
          religious and mystical, and their bitter, although somewhat justified,
          racism towards the Holkovrhys.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hierarchy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no central ruler in the Porturuxean Democracy, instead power
          is focused in a council of presidents, who each are elected to lead a
          planet or small collective of colonies. Traditionally, one member from
          the capital planet of Kipleite heads the council with executive veto
          power, who is currently the economically conservative Andar Balleem.
          The Porturuxean military is considered separate from politics and has
          plenty of autonomy to do as it sees fit, but must answer to the will
          of the council. General Zevon Korringer is the commander-in-chief, who
          dictates the actions of the army as well as assigns missions to the
          Comet operatives, a cell of agents who too work independently and can
          even refuse or adapt orders from the general. The majority of the
          Porturuxean forces are the AAD, or advanced attack droids, and are
          supplemented by pods of living soldiers of diverse specialties.

          <strong>Notable Members</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Incarcerator-Class Portal Deployer - The orbit-to-land teleportal
          deployment drones, or portal deployers, are the backbone of
          Porturuxean military technology. Heavily armed and armored, these
          firebase-like machines can be launched from outside the atmosphere to
          land on a planet&#39;s surface, where they will clear an area before
          establishing a teleportational connection a helicarrier or base, where
          they can constantly summon AAD and soldiers to secure an area. At the
          request of the GDOS, an experimental prototype was developed with the
          capabilities to detain instead of kill, in order to take in desired
          prisoners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comet Commander Delira - In a world of diverse peoples and economies,
          the free market must be protected, except when it&#39;s being used to
          exploit and terrorize citizens. This motivated Porturuxean is
          stationed out in the wilds of Ancap Atoll, keeping tabs on the
          goings-on under P.U.N.K. supervision, and the possible unethical
          transactions taking place involving Colossus, Inc and the Hyjakkers.
          She&#39;s got her hands full, but still got a full grip on the task at
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          AAD Comet Artillery Commander - This hulking droid is the product of
          scientists asking themselves, &#39;if we can make mobile bases in the
          form of portal deployers, can it be done for anti-spacecraft
          turrets?&#39; While not very agile, this thing&#39;s sheer firepower
          from its six independently calibrated cannons makes fighter pilots
          consider twice before swooping in on Porturuxean troops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comet Commander Zacharias - Despite being not very high in rank,
          Zacharias is a name starting to get renown not just among Porturuxean
          leadership, but also members of the Holkovrhys inner circle. He was
          there during the fall of Barter-2 to the forces of Emperor
          Docstiertun, and watched in horror as the entire population was
          slaughtered. Blaming himself for the atrocity, a clear flame of
          vengeance has lit inside his heart, and he will embark on even the
          most difficult assignments if it means he can try to right his wrongs.
          Fortunately for him, he has the inexplicable ability to not die;
          he&#39;s been clinically declared deceased on several occasions, only
          to regain consciousness later. Despite the suggestion he has been
          blessed by a force from above, Zacharias is not religious, and
          maintains he has simply beaten the odds at every encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spec Ops Comet Karkaron - A seasoned operative with a specialty in
          xenobiology, Karkaron strongly believes that the Porturuxean Comets
          are too narrow in scope and ability and are not enough to effectively
          combat the forces the Alliance is assailed by. In his view, the most
          effective intelligence cell acts as a symbiotic organism,
          complementing itself with its varied parts. He has approached both
          General Korringer and President Balleem in forming a new organization
          to include specialists from other races, but even they are hesitant to
          completely open up their intel to their allies, fearing it may
          intercepted in transmission. Karkaron will not give up, however, in
          creating the perfect fighting force, and is more than willing to work
          alongside trustworthy mercs willing to devote their loyalty to the
          Alliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comet Colonel Katherine - In an effort to better understand her new
          allies of the Draconis, Katherine tutored and learned under the famed
          lieutenant general Malingara. She has picked up on most aspects of the
          Integrities that do not openly conflict with Porturuxean policies, and
          as such acts more in alignment with Draconis ideologies than her
          native people. She is a reserved individual who picks up on mental
          flaws, providing profound insight to her allies, and tripping up her
          enemies. She is currently trying to locate the missing soldier Ides
          within enemy territory, but first she has a Hyjakker problem she needs
          to take care of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Factory Comet Portal Deployer - It may be expensive to manufacture,
          but the sheer amount of technology and firepower outfitted in this
          thing ensures it will secure its foothold on the ground. With three
          times as many teleportational gateways, armor capable of resisting
          fighter bombs, and a pair of anti-spacecraft cannons, it is a
          nightmare for enemy forces to deal with. Any territory around it may
          as well be considered lost from the enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Siege - The masterpiece of Porturuxean war science, the Super
          Intelligent EnGagement Engine, or SIEGE, is a massive AAD enhanced by
          hacked Thraxian A.I, capable of leading expeditions and defending
          bases all by itself. Designed by the same Porturuxean inventor who
          created the artificial element cryptopitanium, it is capable of taking
          on spacecrafts with its twin lightning cannons, and perfectly
          analyzing enemy forces with its supply of seeker drones.
        </p>
        <p>
          General Zevon Korringer - Mastermind of the Porturuxean armed forces,
          the rigid General Korringer despises the public eye, preferring to
          recluse himself to his war rooms where he can work in peace. In his
          soldiering days, he lost his right arm and side of his face, which has
          since been augmented with stolen Thraxian cybernetics, augmenting his
          intelligence and lifespan. He sees all the conflicts surrounding
          himself and handles them by dividing them into separate grids with
          their individual details within, such as a master chessboard made up
          of smaller chessboards. He acknowledges sacrifices must be made to
          eventually outwit the enemy, but he does his best to make sure the
          pieces lost are AAD and not living beings. On rare occasions he will
          go out into the field himself, for reasons unknown even to the
          Porturuxean council, but it seems certain he is searching for
          something of great importance to securing his victory.

          <strong>Notable Locations</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Kipleite-2 - The original Porturuxean homeworld of Kipleite was the
          first ever subject to an anti-matter &#39;planet buster&#39; bomb, set
          off by the Holkovrhys Empire generations ago in an early attempt to
          exterminate their race. The Porturuxeans survived, however, rebuilding
          an exact copy of their civilization on the nearest suitable planet,
          and terraforming it in the image of their lost paradise. The capital
          city of New Darsun is home to all races within the Galactic Alliance,
          and houses the Hall of the Council where the various presidents
          convene. They have never forgotten their loss, however, and any
          Holkovrhys that sets foot on the planet will be subject to prejudice,
          whether in alignment with the Empire or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barter-2 - This colonial world filled with swaths of jungle and open
          desert was once a cultural center for the Porturuxeans, housing
          museums of cultural artifacts from across Sector Alpha, until it was
          discovered that underneath the desert sands were veins of murdalyn, a
          highly reactive mineral compound thought only to be artificially
          manufacturable. Once the Holkovrhys caught wind of this, they launched
          an all-out assault on the planet, decimating the defensive forces and
          totally massacring the populace. They have tried to take back this
          planet for its strategic value, but it is protected at all times by a
          full fleet of Empire fighters and helicarriers. Now no one knows what
          the surface has been transformed into.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kila Saido - Still in the infant stages of its life, this planet is
          mostly warm oceans and developing continents, and ruled by epic-class
          fauna capable of razing most developing colonies. The Porturuxeans
          came here far away from the reaches of most other enemy civilizations,
          and established a research colony focused on teleportational
          technology, where they can test new models of portal deployers and the
          like. However, the Thrax feel this is too close to their own
          territory, so the facility is frequently threatened and invaded by
          them. So far, they have not been able to do any lasting damage.
