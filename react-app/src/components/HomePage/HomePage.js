          <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            There will come a time, in the far, far future, when humanity will
            go extinct on the galactic scale, and although their race will fade
            from memory, their legacy within the galaxy leaves a lasting mark.
            This is that era.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full quarter of the galaxy, now designated Sector Alpha or the
            First Sector, has been for the most part mapped out, explored, and
            colonized by multitude of races that make up the Galactic Alliance.
            The Alliance is a kind of league of nations designed to be
            representative of all the various governances and cultures of the
            sentient races that desire mutual prosperity of arts and
            technologies, scientific progress, and philosophies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sector Alpha is not without strife, however; some deviant races
            choose not to subscribe to free trade routes or the idea that all
            sentient beings share similar rights. Space pirates, conquering
            empires at the border, and political saboteurs lurk in the vastness
            of space, and are only somewhat held off by the nations&#39;
            militaries and the Galactic Department of Security (G.D.O.S.).
          </p>
          <p>
            You are a wanderer in these vast worlds, possibly seeking for your
            own personal meaning for existing, or perhaps a mercenary seeking
            adventure and lets each day roll by as they come. Whoever you may
            be, whether a member of the Alliance or its sworn enemy, is up to
            you.
